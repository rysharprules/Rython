## Basic file operations

Open a file with `open(<path>)`. This will be in read-only mode. To change the mode, add the mode element to the call: `open(<path>, mode='w')`. 

_Note: The mode element is assumed so `open(<path>, 'w')` is also correct._

The most common access modes are:

- `r`: Opens the file in read-only mode. Starts reading from the beginning of the file and is the default mode for the open() function.
- `r+`: Opens a file for reading and writing, placing the pointer at the beginning of the file.
- `w`: Opens in write-only mode. The pointer is placed at the beginning of the file and this will overwrite any existing file with the same name. It will create a new file if one with the same name doesn't exist.
- `w+`: Opens a file for writing and reading.
Opens a file for appending new information to it. The pointer is placed at the end of the file. A new file is created if one with the same name doesn't exist.
- `a+`: Opens a file for both appending and reading.

_Note: There are binary versions for all these modes, just add `b`._

You can write to a file with the `write()` function:

````
f = open("test.txt, mode='w')
f.write("some text")
f.close()
````

_Note: The path can be relative or absolute._

You can also use `with` to open, which is self closing, similar to Java `try-with-resources`, so the call to `close` is not necessary. You can read from a file with the `read()` function:

````
with open("test.txt", 'r') as f:
  text = f.read()
print(text)
````



## `shutils` and `os`

These libraries can be imported with `import shutil, os`.

The [shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#module-shutil) module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. In particular, functions are provided which support file copying and removal. 

For operations on individual files, see also the [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os) module. This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
