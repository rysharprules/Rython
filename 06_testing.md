## Static analysis tools

A few common Python static analysis tools are listed below to give you a flavour of the variety out there. This is by no means an exhaustive list!

- [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/): code reformatter
- [Pyflakes](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/): quick checking for common runtime errors
- [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/): a wrapper around pyflakes, plus enforcement of the (somewhat outdated) PEP 8 conventions
- [Mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/): enforces type annotations
- [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/): assorted linting options (error detection, code style)
